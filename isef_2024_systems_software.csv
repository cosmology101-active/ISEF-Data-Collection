2024,"Pendyala, Ishan (School: Friendswood High School)",FlashGuard: Developing Epileptic Activity and Trigger Content Detection Software Using a Computer-Based Application for Real Time Monitoring and Seizure Reporting,Systems Software,United States of America,TX,,Fourth Award of $500,"In the virtual realm, individuals with photosensitive epilepsy encounter challenges using electronic devices exposed to visual stimuli. These stimuli, characterized by rapidly flashing elements in high contrast, can trigger seizures, rendering the Internet and computer applications unpredictable and hazardous for affected individuals. To address this issue and enhance accessibility, a novel approach was devised to assess the average rate of frame changes on a user's screen. This innovative method involves converting frames to the CIELAB color space, replicating human perceptual qualities, and calculating the average grayscale of the resulting differential frame. The weighted average of the last 30 differentials is then fed into a logistic regression model embedded in FlashGuard, the compiled application. Unlike browser extensions, FlashGuard is compatible with all computer applications and provides real-time analysis, surpassing current models that rely on recorded data. During testing, FlashGuard demonstrated an 80% accuracy and a 76% precision in identifying True Positives for seizure-inducing videos. Anticipated to be more effective in real-world scenarios with more variation in virtual environments, FlashGuard serves as a proactive solution, preempting seizure-inducing stimuli and thereby increasing device accessibility for photosensitive individuals. This application acts as a safety barrier, allowing users to engage with devices while mitigating the risks associated with potentially harmful stimuli.",SOFT006,24864

This silent epidemic encompasses a range of heart and blood vessel disorders, with coronary heart disease and stroke reigning as the deadliest culprits. More alarmingly, one third of these deaths occur prematurely, before individuals reach the age of 70, robbing them of precious years and leaving scars on families and communities. This project aims to develop an integrated AI-powered system that combines a mobile companion app for continuous monitoring, an AI doctor's software for real-time diagnosis, and a patient location tracking system for emergency response, all combined to predict heart attacks from (CVDs) with 15 minutes ahead time. This comprehensive solution addresses the challenges of early detection, timely intervention, and access to emergency care for individuals with (CVDs). While the concept of using AI for CVD monitoring and diagnosis is not entirely new, the specific implementation and integration of AI into a companion app and an AI doctor’s software is a novel approach. The combination of real-time monitoring, AI-powered diagnosis, and predictive risk assessment using patient medical profiles and genetic information makes this project stand out from previous attempts. The project also addresses the limitations of existing solutions by providing a comprehensive and personalized healthcare solution for CVD prevention and management.",SOFT008,24777
2024,"Sears, Maria (School: Monte Vista High School)",Help! I Need Somebody: An Assistive Device That Notifies Emergency Services Once a Fall Has Been Detected,Systems Software,United States of America,CO,,"Arizona State University: Arizona State University ISEF Scholarship (valued at up to $58,000 each)","36 million falls are recorded every year among the elderly population. 35,000 of those falls result in death. There are fall detection devices already available, but they are expensive and only detect falls 85% of the time. Those fall detection devices use an accelerometer and gyroscope to measure if a fall has occurred, rather than using vitals. They also do not directly call emergency services or emergency contact. Instead, they notify a 24/7 monitoring center and they make the call. I developed a device that utilizes two modules, an accelerometer and pulse oximeter. With these modules I set constraints that when exceeded a timer would countdown from 20 seconds. The user would have 20 seconds to press a button that would tell the timer to shut off and reset the device. If the button is not pressed within 20 seconds, a pre-recorded message is sent to the attached Bluetooth device through a Bluetooth module. The pre-recorded message would include information that might affect patient care, like the user's location, list of pre-existing conditions and medicines, and any allergies that could put the user at risk. By using data from a pulse oximeter and accelerometer modules, the device was able to accurately detect if a fall had occurred. The device looked for an extreme increase in heart rate and zero movement to detect a fall. This device could be utilized by older adults that are at risk of falling and still want to live independently.",SOFT010,25129
2024,"Dhoot, Arav (School: Neerja Modi School)",Remote Detection and Severity Classification of Parkinson's Disease Using Markerless Videos in Uncontrolled Settings,Systems Software,India,,DELHI,Fourth Award of $500,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Yet, it lacks a cure. Timely detection and treatment can significantly slow the progression of symptoms, yet access to neurologists is a challenge, particularly in rural and remote regions. Therefore, this study aims to develop a system for the detection and classification of PD using in-the-wild videos for early-stage diagnostic evaluation. For this research, a novel dataset consisting of videos from open-source domains with varying PD intensities and gait abnormalities was constructed. Using a human pose estimation (HPE) model, HPE images were generated from the videos. Scaled and centered HPE images were used to extract joint coordinates to train a 10-tree Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and generate spatiotemporal images—images produced by the superposition of the average of 17 HPE images. 7 modified classification models (ViT-Tiny, ViT-Small, ViT-Base, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, 5-layer ConvNet, and 6-layer ConvNet; each incorporating the previously trained RFC as an additional layer) were trained on 19218 spatiotemporal images. Using shallower models required less computational resources for training and inference compared to state-of-the-art models. Training on spatiotemporal images communicated greater computational information to the models, while incorporating the RFC provided greater global context during the classification. Upon testing on 2402 images, the models surpassed state-of-the-art performance, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 both achieving 99.88% accuracy. The models were tested in a clinical trial (n=27). All models displayed an accuracy close (within 5%) to the performance observed on the testing dataset, with ViT-Base and ResNet-34 achieving an accuracy of 96.30%.",SOFT013,24611
2024,"Lustig, Milan (School: Cold Spring Harbor Jr/Sr High School)",A Configurable Compiled Programming Language With Integrated Transpilation,Systems Software,United States of America,NY,,"Third Award of $1,000","Language workbenches and product lines allow users to customize programming languages by providing a framework for the creation of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). They allow for quicker language development, but still require some programming. The customization offered by workbenches and product lines is focused towards adapting to new domains. The purpose of this research is to introduce a new approach to language customization. This research proposes a language designed to be easily customized and configured for new users, rather than new domains, while still offering language extension. Users can simply select options to configure the syntax and semantics of their personal preferences. This offers a more approachable take to language customization than most language workbenches, especially for inexperienced developers. Developers may also be able to more smoothly adapt to new languages if user-oriented customization is applied similarly to gradual learning. User-oriented customization is also accompanied by an inter-configuration transpiler and standardized language form, ensuring that code written in custom configurations is still readable by all users. User-oriented customization was implemented in a general purpose compiled C-based language in which users are able to configure the syntax and semantics by editing a Tom's Obvious Minimal Language (TOML) configuration file. From the creation of this language, it can be concluded that user-oriented customization can reasonably be implemented into large modern general-purpose compiled languages and, when accompanied by one-to-one syntax translation between forms, can be used by many people with many configurations with no added friction.",SOFT014,25132
2024,"Mandic, Bora (School: Saint Paul Academy and Summit School)",SignalGrab: A Machine Learning Approach to Helping Color Blind Drivers,Systems Software,United States of America,MN,MN,Fourth Award of $500,"There are nearly fourteen million individuals with color blindness in the United States. Many individuals with color blindness struggle with differentiating between red and green traffic signals, particularly at night when other visual cues are unavailable. This can lead to traffic hazards for both them and those around them. SignalGrab is a novel approach to solving this problem through a machine-learning-powered mobile app that drivers can use to easily recognize traffic signals. A specialized dataset was created, containing nearly six thousand labeled images of traffic signals at night in diverse conditions. This dataset was used to train a custom machine-learning algorithm that was embedded in an Android app, built using Android Studio. The app has a minimalistic user interface and provides audible information about the type of approaching traffic lights to minimize driver distractions. SignalGrab reliably solves the issue of traffic light recognition for color-blind drivers. In real-life testing, SignalGrab correctly recognizes traffic signals with an accuracy of 97.1 percent.",SOFT015,25086
2024,"Chen, Yi-Jhe (School: The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University)",Back Propagation Neural Network Based Framework for Unknown Malware Detection,Systems Software,Taiwan,,,Non-Trivial: 10 scholarships for Non-trivial,"This project explores the application of language models in creating backpropagation-based neural networks for the detection of known and unknown malware. A representation learning model (RPLM) is proposed in this research. The detection framework involves three key steps: (1) disassembly of executable samples into assembly code, (2) extraction of assembly text to form representation vector using the proposed RPLM language models, and (3) classification of the representation vectors by a fully-connected neural network to detect presence of malware. Experiments on malware collected from 2012 through 2023 showed a 98.28% accuracy. Furthermore, experiments on unknown family of malware achieved 97.25% average detection rate. Finally, experiments on training model with known malware up to year N for detection of unknown malware in future years, showed that this framework can maintain 95.63% and 93.01% detection rates in year N+1 and N+2, respectively. An ensembled model was also proposed to enhance the robustness of the detector. Combining features extracted from different language models using fusion techniques could enhance the robustness of the malware detection framework. Experiments shown that fusion can improve known and unknown malware detection rate to 99.39 % and 96.16%, respectively. This research demonstrates feasibility of leveraging natural language models for the detection of malware from low-level assembly code. In comparison to signature-based anti-virus software, the proposed natural language based neural network, by having high and reliable detection rate for known and unknown malwares, is a robust new way to safeguard system security.",SOFT019,24824
2024,"Kumar, Rahul (School: Brisbane Grammar School)","EmSafe: Further Improving the Emergency Call Service and the Development of Digital Emergency Management Infrastructure for Industrial, Event, and Public Use",Systems Software,Australia,,NSW,Fourth Award of $500,"Despite the improvements made to the Emergency Call Service by the original EmSafe Project, numerous issues have been found that impact the safety and security of people around the world. Emergency Management systems for public spaces and events are severely lacking and do not provide information in an easily understandable or accessible way. Further, GPS based systems have proven inaccurate when used indoors, impacting the ability for event and public space emergency response teams, as well as state-run Emergency Services to provide support when they cannot find the people they have been tasked with helping. Further, fly-in fly out workers in various fields have had difficulty accessing location specific emergency management information, which is often only shared in an inaccessible email or during onboarding training. This lacklustre approach to sharing this crucial information results in several preventable mining deaths each year in Australia alone. To resolve these issues, the EmSafe project was updated and two new pieces of software were developed. EmSafe Beacons were developed to allow for highly accurate, scenario specific responses to emergencies that occur in public spaces. This software can work on all devices and uses physical stickers to determine the location of a user inside a building. EmSafe for Industry was developed to support fly-in fly-out workers and provide them with location-specific emergency management information. This software can run with or without GPS support, ensuring workers anywhere in the world can access jobsite specific information.

2024,"Frias, Diego (School: Oregon Episcopal School)",Engineering a WebAssembly-Based Shell,Systems Software,United States of America,OR,,National Security Agency Research Directorate : Second Place Award “Cybersecurity”,"This project creates a POSIX-style shell that runs WebAssembly, allowing programs to be shared between developers without safety issues, platform incompatibilities, determinism problems, or complex build processes, while also innovating a whole new way to interact with such programs. The core of the project is the virtual machine, which can execute programs compiled to WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that is targetable by all major compilers. The shell provides standard features, such as pipes, redirections, and programmability, but more importantly, acts as an environment for the virtual machine. Because the shell can configure the machine, the user of the shell can control the execution of programs on their system to a greater degree. To eliminate the risk of an unreproducible binary from destroying important data, programs are isolated from the file system by default, unless allowed by the programmer on a per-directory basis. Furthermore, specific functions can be dynamically loaded from the program into the shell environment, as regular shell commands. This allows certain functions to be tested, benchmarked, or used ad-hoc, from the command line. The shell also comes equipped with an in-memory file system, in which the side effects of an executable can be incrementally viewed and applied via a file system that does not exist on disk. In summary, this project innovates a new way for developers to run programs in deterministic, reproducible environments in which they may have full control over the side effects of a program.",SOFT024,25061

However, as technologies evolve, traditional methods struggle to effectively counter threats such as cyberattacks, data breaches, and system failures. This research introduced the novel concept of ""infinite redundancy"" using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to map data throughout a finite physical memory. Despite arbitrary corruption, the data could be reconstructed from only one uncorrupted memory subset by analyzing frequency spectrum patterns, much like a full holographic image could be reproduced from just a fragment of a holographic film. The proposed model demonstrated remarkable fault tolerance compared to traditional redundancy models, being able to reconstruct up to 89% data corruption with 98% accuracy through the software-based techniques. This comes with a tradeoff of 3.55x storage usage compared to the 3x storage overhead of the state-of-the-art triple-modular redundancy, while traditional methods cannot withstand more than 50% corruption. The proposed model aims to revolutionize data storage, providing novel approaches to handle the increasing importance of data in the modern world. This includes applications like enabling long-term deep space probes to survive without failure in the harsh radiation environment. By pushing the boundaries of data storage, new possibilities can be unlocked enabling transformative advancements in how data is perceived, utilized, and benefited from.",SOFT032,25481
2024,"Song, Eric (School: Yorktown High School)",Improving the Ransomware Detection/Mitigation Proof-of-Concept With Machine Learning,Systems Software,United States of America,NY,,Fourth Award of $500National Security Agency Research Directorate : Second Place Award “Cybersecurity”,"Ransomware attacks render data unusable and demand a ransom in order to restore data integrity. These attacks cost billions of dollars every year at the individual, industrial, and national security levels. As ransomware poses a big threat to computer systems today, research in the field is active. However, there is greater emphasis with regard to prevention, rather than incident response. Preventative systems, while effective, can be bypassed by attackers, given enough time. Incident response aims to address this issue by mitigating attacks as they happen. Key extraction can be used for incident response when dealing with ransomware. By intercepting the ransomware's encryption key, restoring data can be done without payment of ransom. Random forest models were constructed to test the feasibility of using machine learning in combination with this technology, due to the time-sensitive nature of key extraction. To do so, a large dataset comprised of 30,000 samples was developed by testing binaries and outputting behavioral data. Afterwards, 100 random forest models were built with different random states to test the efficacy of random forests. The models demonstrate that machine learning can be incorporated into the system with a better detection rate than the previous proof-of-concept (99.3% versus 66.7%). Additionally, the efficiency of the random forest is viable for use with key extraction. In the future, this integration can be further developed to become more optimized and have better capability in defeating advanced ransomware. Additionally, different models can be used to analyze their advantages over the random forest in ransomware detection.",SOFT033,25562

Partial hand loss is the most prevalent form of amputation among upper limb amputations. Community efforts have created affordable 3D-printed prosthetic hands for upper-limb amputees. However, these hands are not easily customized without CAD experience, and given the variety of partial hand loss, they are often not well-suited for the user. This project provided streamlined software for the semi-automatic generation of a prosthetic hand optimized for an individual and focused on accessibility and adaptability. After manipulating a pseudo skeleton of joints and ""painting"" a scan of a residual limb to define the socket, the user would simply export the software's generated files for 3D-printing. To create variable flexibility and breathability in the sockets, a pattern of holes was generated across the mesh. The first phase of testing proved the socket's ability to retain a proper fit on the residual limb with minimal displacement under loads nearing 100N. The second phase of testing involved a qualitative assessment that validated the prostheses' robustness, ease of manufacturing, and kinematics. The software required low computational-cost with generation times varying from a matter of seconds to a maximum of 15 minutes.

However, most OSS libraries are built upon a chain of other dependent OSS libraries known as transitive dependencies. Often, software developers may not be aware of whether the OSS they use contains vulnerable, dependent libraries, which could potentially be exploited by cybercriminals. I developed SecureOSS, a multi-modular cybersecurity product that interfaces with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive OSS dependencies. The workflow starts with the Dependency Parser, which uses a novel version of the Depth First Search Algorithm to traverse the project's dependency tree. As it parses, it generates the Software Bill of Materials(SBOM) in CycloneDX format which catalogs the project's direct and transitive dependencies. It also generates a supplemental report of Community Health Analytics, including Open Source Software (CHAOSS) metrics which enriches the SBOM by offering insights into the activity and responsiveness of OSS projects. For the identified dependencies, the Concurrency Manager efficiently orchestrates parallel queries, leveraging the NVD API Interface to search for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE). The Cache Manager stores frequently accessed dependencies, reducing redundant API calls while the Rate Limiter ensures adherence to NVD's request policies. Using NVD’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System(CVSS) scores, the vulnerabilities' impact is found.

However, their potential is limited by challenges such as decoherence. Decoherence necessitates quantum circuits to be reduced as much as possible, a task often achieved through manual, time-consuming optimization techniques. This study investigated the potential of automating a technique called gate merging to significantly reduce optimization time, improve the performance of quantum computers and potentially accelerate research. The proposed algorithm works based on two principles: gate merging and gate commutativity. It addresses circuit optimization in a step-by-step manner. First, gates are categorized based on their corresponding qubits. Then, all potential pairs for merging identified and established commutativity rules are utilized to bring them closer within the circuit. The algorithm then searches for redundant gate pairs and removes them from the circuit. Finally, the algorithm prioritizes and merges the remaining pairs. The effectiveness of the algorithm was validated on around 100 benchmark reversible quantum circuits obtained from online databases, such as RevLib and tweedledum databases. While the exact optimization value varied between algorithms, the average improvement based on the tests reached approximately 6.25%, and the time spent on optimization was significantly reduced. This project demonstrates the potential of automated optimization for improving quantum circuit efficiency and accelerating the development of quantum algorithms.

Current development environments and programming languages are simply not accessible enough for the visually-impaired; less than 1% even attempt to learn to code. AuralStudio seeks to solve this issue through the creation of a new programming language and a development environment that: 1) includes a novel, Turing-complete, bytecode interpreter, 2) eliminates the mouse/keyboard, 3) provides multi-sensory feedback with a control pad, 4) highlights code's inherently hierarchical nature with acyclic digraphs, and 5) redesigns error messages for brevity/clarity. AuralStudio is tested on blind and low-vision students at a flagship government school for the blind, and is shown to significantly improve programming times, reduce bugs and provide a far more accessible and immersive development experience overall. Test results indicated no statistically significant difference between development time (from file creation to output) between visually-impaired and sighted students.

However, these current models of GPT detectors determine their results by only analyzing one text. This project aims to provide a novel comparative approach to detecting unethical AI use by utilizing well-known metrics while also introducing new text metrics such as vocabulary levels. The key distinguishing feature of this project is its comparative approach: rather than assessing individual texts to detect AI usage like typical GPT detectors, this project compares metrics between two distinct pieces of text– a known human written sample and a suspected AI-generated text. Following the comparisons, statistical techniques were utilized to determine whether the two pieces originated from humans. If the disparity reached a certain level, it suggested the involvement of AI in generating the text.

First, the system recognizes user eye gestures like left or up with machine learning and a template-matching algorithm. Then, it converts the eye gestures to words through a keyboard that supports English, Spanish, and Chinese. For efficiency, the system employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a suitable sentence with words typed by the user and the context. Finally, the system provides text-to-speech and social media post services for both verbal and digital eye-gesture communication. Simulations conclude that sentence generation with LLMs can improve text-entry rate by 81% while maintaining 90% of semantic similarity. Usability studies with 30 participants show that GazeLink can recognize eye gestures with 94.1% accuracy in varying lighting. After rapidly learning the user interface in under 10 attempts, first-time participants typed sentences of various lengths with their eyes at 15.1 words per minute, which is 7.2x faster than the common low-tech solution E-Tran.

While progress has been made in other areas of convex optimization, advancement in SOCP has been slow in the last 30 years due to the computational costs involved with high-dimensional constraints. To address this challenge, this research made several key innovations. First, because it is highly computationally expensive to compute the exact search direction in the algorithm at each iteration, I developed a technique to maintain an approximate solution, significantly lowering the computational cost. However, high-dimensional constraints still create a bottleneck even with this approximation technique. To overcome this, I designed a novel method to decompose large constraints, converting the problem into another SOCP with smaller constraints. This key step greatly speeds up the runtime, and it is also a significant theoretical contribution that may be applied to other forms of conic programming. Combining approximation techniques with cone-splitting, the new algorithm I designed outperforms the previous best SOCP algorithm by a factor of a square root of the number of constraints. I mathematically proved that the new approach converges to the optimal solution in matrix multiplication time, reaching the theoretical limit. I developed and tested a software SOCP solver, laying the groundwork for researchers to build upon theoretical advancements.

To address this issue, innovative technology has been developed for interaction with machines and controlling a mouse with head movements. Using a laptop's camera for commands eliminates the need for additional hardware for accurate control. The proposed system tackles the problem of limited input options while also minimizing erratic movements for people with neck movement restrictions. The system uses face mesh technology to map facial features accurately and translate head movements into cursor movements, and the data is amplified to fill the entire screen while maintaining comfortable movement. Exponential moving average (EMA) was used to improve cursor control by giving more weight to recent data points, thus reducing jitter. Because of the latency caused by EMA, Kalman filter is utilized for its predictive capabilities, which significantly enhance the system's responsiveness and enable more accurate real-time cursor movements.

However, current methods can suffer from issues like slow convergence and getting trapped in poor local minima. In this work, we propose a novel gradient descent algorithm with dual adaptive learning rates and momenta that aims to improve optimization and achieve faster convergence. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the learning rate and momentum for each weight and bias based on the magnitude and direction of its partial derivative while incorporating a slow and fast gradient, moving at different paces along the loss function. Weights and biases with larger gradient magnitudes are updated more aggressively, while those with noisy gradients are updated more conservatively. The momentum is also adapted to accelerate training along dimensions with consistent gradient directions and dampen oscillations in other dimensions. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on various deep neural network architectures and datasets. Results demonstrate faster decreases in the training loss and test error compared to the current state-of-the-art ML optimizers, and other adaptive methods. The improved optimization enables reduced training times and generally leads to better model performance.

2024,"Kolb, Antonia (School: King School)",DETICKT IT: A Machine Learning-Based Application for Real-Time Tick Identification and Spatiotemporal Disease Risk Assessment,Systems Software,United States of America,CT,,"Third Award of $1,000","There is an alarming increase in the population of ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs), with 475,000 cases reported annually, some of which are fatal. Due to limited training, healthcare providers and the public cannot always accurately identify ticks and their associated infections, leading to delayed diagnoses and treatments. Additionally, the prevalence rates of different disease-causing pathogens vary based on geographic locations. To facilitate the identification process and provide an expedited risk assessment of TBDs, a machine learning-based iOS application, DETICKT IT, was created. The app features a ResNet50V2 (transfer learning) deep convolutional neural network built in Python for combining real-time tick-species identification with a novel ""window"" algorithm and a location-based tick-risk assessment by embedding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's spatiotemporal tick and pathogen surveillance statistics. Users can receive an immediate and accurate analysis to determine whether they are at risk of contracting certain TBDs based on their geographic location. The app is able to accurately identify the ten most common tick species in North and South America: American dog tick, Asian Longhorned tick, Brown dog tick, Eastern blacklegged tick, Western blacklegged tick, Groundhog tick, Gulf Coast tick, Lone star tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, and soft tick, with an overall accuracy of 97% and precision, recall, and F1 score metrics of 0.96, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. This freely accessible app shows promise in assisting tick bite victims with their decision to seek further medical assistance, particularly those with underlying health conditions.",SOFT048,25516

L.I.S.E.S. (Legislative Information Simplification and Enhancement System), a novel pipeline integrating GPT-4, a Large Language Model (LLM), achieves this goal. The system leverages the Gunning Fog Index (GFI) and Flesch-Kincaid Score (FKS) for readability assessment, with results indicating a 121.5% FKS increase from full bills and a 52.3% enhancement over provided summaries. GFI metrics reveal a 61.8% and 44.5% decrease from full and provided texts, respectively. Consistently high ROUGE-L scores across six Legislative Congresses reflect robust information retention. To augment summaries below the 0.5 ROUGE-L benchmark, L.I.S.E.S. employs a feedback loop utilizing a Genetic Algorithm, refined by a novel fitness function integrating FKS, GFI, and ROUGE-L, yielding a 29.89% average improvement in ROUGE-L scores. Additionally, to evaluate the cognitive load of the created summaries, a specialized Psycholinguistic Cognitive Load Neural Network (PCL-NN) model was developed. This model exhibits superior performance in calculating the cognitive load of AI-generated summaries, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, which outclasses standard LSTM and CNN models. The PCL-NN validates the quality of the summaries and their cognitive accessibility by demonstrating a 15.7% improvement in accuracy and a 21.5% error reduction relative to other models. L.I.S.E.S. not only streamlines the conveyance of legislative information but also embodies the transformative potential of AI in fostering informed civic engagement.",SOFT051,25510

An individual's risk of developing dementia is influenced by various genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, among others. Predicting dementia risk may enable individuals to employ mitigation strategies or lifestyle changes to delay dementia onset. Current computational approaches to dementia prediction only return risk upon narrow categories of variables and do not account for interactions between different risk variables. The proposed framework utilizes a novel holistic approach to dementia risk prediction and is the first to incorporate various sources of tabular environmental pollution and lifestyle factor data with network systems biology-based genetic data. LightGBM gradient boosting was employed to ensure validity of included factors.This approach successfully models interactions between variables through an original weighted integration method coined Sysable. Multiple machine learning models trained the algorithm to reduce reliance on a single model. The developed approach surpassed all existing dementia risk prediction approaches, with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 99%, geometric accuracy of 92%, and AUROC of 91.7%. A transfer learning model was also implemented. De-biasing algorithms were run on the model via the AI Fairness 360 Library. Effects of demographic disparities on dementia prevalence were analyzed to potentially highlight areas in need and promote equitable and accessible care. The resulting model was additionally integrated into a user-friendly app providing holistic predictions and personalized risk mitigation strategies. The developed model successfully employs holistic computational dementia risk prediction for clinical use.",SOFT052,25850

Exhibiting lower germination rates, fake seeds cost farmers up to two-thirds of their crops, and, exacerbated by climate change, lead to global food shortages, starvation, and political unrest. The issue stems from the inability to trace seed distribution chains and differentiate genuine seeds from counterfeit ones. A promising new idea suggests marking seeds with biopolymer tags, but their verification requires a costly Raman spectrometer and an Internet connection, posing obvious obstacles for smallholder farmers. This project proposes an affordable anti-counterfeit seed protection system combining biopolymer tags, cryptography, and visual transformers. The system aims to provide cost-effective counterfeit detection for farmers and seed manufacturers, ensuring that the verification process is swift and reliable, and tolerates intermittent Internet access. The system consists of three components: identification of a unique, unclonable biopolymer tag by a novel algorithm (Visual Transformer), verification with a cryptographic signature, and a public blockchain to trace ownership-changing transactions. All steps can be done on a smartphone or another inexpensive computing device. I have built a prototype with Raspberry Pi. With my original pre-training method, the algorithm reached 100% accuracy in identifying biopolymer tags. According to my statistical analysis, the approach reduces the share of counterfeit seeds from 50% to 6.6% if only 5 seeds per bag are checked, and to 3.5%, with 10 seeds. Adding the blockchain further reduces the expected share of undetected counterfeit seeds to 0.05% or 0.005%, respectively.",SOFT058,26007
